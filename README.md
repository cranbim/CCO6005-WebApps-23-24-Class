# CCO6005 WebApps 2023-24 Code Examples
Week by week this repo will build up examples to support demo's in class and working examples to help you grasp concepts and techniques.
You can copy snippets of code into your own work, and sometimes that is appropriate, but most of the time you will learn nothing by doing so.
Try things for yourself. Work out how they work, and bend them to your own specific uses.
There are many ways to achieve the same outcomes and you are encouraged to research and try other approaches and API's to build your own solution.
